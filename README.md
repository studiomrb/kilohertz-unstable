# kilohertz-unstable
This is the official repository of the unstable version of the Kilohertz raspberry 3 image.

Within the next days, a pre-release of the Kilohertz image file will be uploaded here, intended to be a plug-and-play solution to create new Kilohertz nodes that can report their findings into a github repository.

In order to request a pre-pre-release for the Kilohertz image, please send me an email to martin@martinreiche.com using my public key, which is available at http://martinreiche.com/about/imprint
